============

Just install the extension through the extension manager and include the static TypoScript to your root page and you're ready to go.

Addtionally you can set some settings in the TypoScript constant manager. t3jquery is supported.

There's two plugins: One for an image slideshow and one for a content slider. For the content slider you have to add some records to a storage folder first and include them in the plugin afterwards. The settings in the plugins should be self-explanatory.
